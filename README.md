# PubHaus

Super barebones blog starter for DAOs

## Stack 
- Poster
- DAOHaus
- The Graph
- Gatsby 

## Features: 
- Renders static pages from DAO docs
- Follows DAOhaus/Poster integration models
- Content can be stored on IPFS or on chain
- Data is cached on the graph

## Benefits: 
- Allows people to read DAO posts without loading heavy apps
- Maximum uptime. If the build, subgraph, or RPC is down, content remains up, loading fast as always
- A new place to focus on a community's thoughts and ideas, not the dials and buttons of admin
- Completely customizable. 
## Limitations 
- Currently no automatic build
- Barebones hack project. 
- Has no styles
- Does not use a proprietary Gatsby plugin for accessing Poster subgraph data
- Does not link back to DAOhaus


Overall, this is just a repo for getting started.
